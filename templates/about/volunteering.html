<h2 id="volunteering-at-emf">Volunteering at EMF</h2>
<div class="intro-text">
  <p>EMF is a non-profit event, entirely organised by volunteers. Nobody is paid to work on EMF, and everyone who attends (with very few exceptions<a href="#footnote">*</a>) pays for their own ticket. This includes the core organisers.</p>
  <p>We’d like everyone to consider volunteering to help the event run smoothly, even if it is only for an hour or two.</p>
  <p><small id="footnote">* We provide free tickets for qualified First Aid staff who must work a minimum of three eight-hour shifts during the event.</small></p>
</div>

<h3 id="how-to-volunteer">How volunteering works</h3>
<p>We understand that everyone who helps with EMF has other commitments and we plan ahead to cope with this.</p>
<p>We have two golden rules:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Don’t over-commit yourself</li>
  <li>Tell us if you can’t get something done</li>
</ul>
<p>Nobody will criticise you if you can't do something, and telling us quickly means we can handle the situation.</p>

<h3 id="volunteering-before-the-event">Volunteering before the event</h3>
<p>Running an event like EMF requires a huge amount of planning to make sure the event runs smoothly. This starts a year or more in advance.</p>
<p><strong>We're looking for people to help organise the event</a></strong>. If this is something that interests you <a href="{{ url_for('base.volunteer_roles') }}">take a look at the list of roles we're looking to fill</a>.</p>

<h3 id="helping-out-during-the-event">Helping out during the event</h3>
<p>During the event, there are plenty of roles which need to be filled, from construction to cooking for volunteers.</p>
<p>Closer to the event, you’ll be able to log in to the volunteer system which allows you to sign up for shifts. Volunteers who complete a shift will receive a delicious free meal from our volunteer kitchen.</p>

<h3 id="helping-with-setup-teardown">Helping with setup &amp; teardown</h3>
<p>We’re grateful for help setting up the event, and especially tearing it down.</p>
<p>If you want to help with either setup or teardown you will need a ticket to EMF and <u>permission from us to turn up early or stay after the event ends</u>. We do not allow under-18's on site during setup or teardown without explicit permission.</p>
<p>During setup and teardown, EMF is a construction site and we are liable for your safety. If you don’t follow instructions we will be forced to remove you from site, for everyone's safety.</p>
<p>If you’re on site for setup/teardown you have to help with everything - not just what you’re interested in. There’s plenty of lifting and shifting that requiring a degree of physical fitness and mobility. If you’re not actively helping, we will ask you to leave.</p>
